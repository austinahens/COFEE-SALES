  ## Data Cleaning/ Transformation
   In the beginning of Data Preparation Phase, the following tasks were performed.
  
  1.  A column for Revenue was added using operator =D2*H2.
  2.  A column for month was added using =TEXT(B2,"mm")
  3.  A column for monthName was added =TEXT(B2,"mmm")
  4.  A column for weekday was added using =WEEKDAY(B2,2)
  5.  A column for WeekDay Name was added using =TEXT(B2,"DDDD")
  6.  A column for Hour using =HOUR(C2)
